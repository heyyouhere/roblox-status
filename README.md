# Roblox Status Bot
Simple bot, that parses [this](https://status.roblox.com) website, and watches on Roblox Status changes. It'll notify team, in Telegram group chat, if something is up (or down).

## Get your token
Go to [Telegram](https://telegram.org), and find [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). He'll guide you through the process.

## Usage
```console
echo <your_token_here> >> token.txt
python3 main.py
```

## mytelegrambot.py
I'm testing my own super simple (yet another) telegram bot api library. Feedback is welcome.
